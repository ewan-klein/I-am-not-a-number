\subsection{Communication}
\label{sec:communication}

One of the key things we discovered is that many people felt poorly
informed about the nature and purpose of the monitoring
project. Although they were all included in the email that was sent
out explaining the details of the project, many failed to read it
among the deluge of daily email. They noticed the sensors placed in
the meeting rooms, and they read the notice there, but when sensors
and gateways were placed around their open plan office area, there was
open speculation and discussion about why they were there. 

\subsection{Management}
\label{sec:management}

Most people felt concerned about a variety of building issues and
mentioned quite a few problems other than access to meeting rooms. In
their daily experience, problems with the toilets, slow lifts, and the
temperature of office space and of meeting rooms were significant
complaints. In addition, the way the open plan offices were structured
seemed to create many issues, primarily related to noise. People did
not have private spaces to make phone calls or have one-on-one
conversations, and informal meeting spaces in the open plan areas led
to meetings being overheard by everyone, whether they needed to
participate or not, and they found this disruptive to their
work. There were also gender-related issues, such as men not wanting
to be seen leaving early when they had the school run, or menopausal
women needing to be able to have more control over the temperature in
their space.  

In terms of how building issues are managed, there were also a variety
of complaints. Because the University is renting part of the building
from a third party, they have less control over the management of
building issues. Participants mentioned that the way that the
maintenance staff treats issues can be prone to a box-ticking
approach; for example if someone complains about the temperature in a
space, after a few days someone will come, will measure the
temperature at the point where air is coming out of a vent, and then
say that everything is fine and as it should be, without considering
the temperature in the different parts of the room where different
people are working, or how the sun or lack thereof affects the
temperature over the course of the day.

People also mentioned that although there was supposed to be a
committee of staff providing input for the design of the new
Information Services space in Argyle House, the committee was not
given the opportunity to provide significant input before the
move. They were assured that after the move they would be consulted
again, but up to the present time that had not hapened.

Finally, some participants noted that a DIY approach to environmentla
monitoring has already been carried out, where a few building
occupants had designed and deployed
their own devices (based on Raspberry Pi) to measure room temperature and
other aspects of the working environment. 

\subsection{Perceptions of monitoring}
\label{sec:perc-monit}

There were mixed perceptions of the monitoring project, and we
identified three archetypal responses, summarised as follows: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{I don't care} --- I'm already being monitored in so many ways
  that are so much more personal e.g., CCTV in the building, mobile
  phone apps, etc. 
\item \textit{Data is great} --- There are so many ways that we could use
  data like this to improve our work experience. I'd
  be happy to be monitored in even more personal ways if that would
  bring benefit to me. 
\item \textit{Show me the change} --- Is all this monitoring really necessary?
  Can I see what data you’re collecting? Will the data actually be
  used to inform a change? How will I know if it is? Might there be
  easier or simpler ways to achieve the necessary change? 
\end{enumerate}

The first archetype was typically either an under- or over-informed
person who was not likely to react negatively to the monitoring. The
second archetype was typically a person with previous experience with
using sensors or data analytics in their work. They were not likely to
react negatively to the monitoring and were eager and willing to
contribute ideas and suggestions about more monitoring options and how
they could be used to improve user experience. The third response was
the most common and represents people with the most potential to view
IoT initiatives skeptically or negatively. 
\todo{
  Can we get incude a rough percentage of people in each of the three categories?
}

The majority of participants who fell in this category were
nevertheless willing to engage or be engaged.  Management
relationships and trust For a number of respondents, the key issues
was the relationship between management and employees and what was
communicated through that relationship. There was a lot of concern
that monitoring that started out for one purpose could be exploited
for another, depending on the type of manager.  It all depends on how
the data is used – single biggest concern = management (not bothered
by general environmental monitoring, but individual monitoring e.g. of
desk use more concerning – not as much concerned about facilities
managers as bosses)
